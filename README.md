Full Stack Developer, focused on technologies such as React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python and C#. I am currently working with the T3 stack, which includes TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. My objective is to thrive a career as a developer working remotely in a international company.

In 2018 I earned my bachelor's degree in Business Management. Even so, over the years, I've had the opportunity to wear different hats â€“ as a Graphic Designer, Digital Marketing Analyst and now, as a Web Developer.

Between 2018 and 2020, I took a bold step and lived in Sydney, Australia, to explore life in a new cultural context. There I started my studies in programming and had the opportunity to live and work using only English. Aside from that, I am also proficient in Italian, in addition to my native language, Portuguese.

I am known as a quick learner with strong interpersonal skills, always ready to support my colleagues and work collaboratively in fast-paced environments. I find myself very creative which leads to find innovative solutions, while my passion for technology motivates me to create outstanding web experiences. Feel free to get in contact if you feel like we could colaborate! =)
